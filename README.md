## Homework objective

The aim of this homework was to write some important algorithms by ourselves. The homework is divided into four exercises:
1. <b>Hashing task!</b> where we had to implement hash function and use Bloom Filter
2. <b>Alphabetical Sort </b>which required implementation of Counting Sort algorithm
3. <b>Find similar wines!</b> where we used k-means clustering algorithm
4. <b>K-means can go wrong!</b> which was the theoretical question

## Repository structure

1. <b>MAIN.ipnyb</b> - the file contains commented code solving questions 1-3
2. <b>Theoretical Explanation.pdf</b> - a pdf file with written explanation for question 4
3. .png and .jpg files used for Theoretical Explanation
